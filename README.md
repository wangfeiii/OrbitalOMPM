MOTIVATION

Have you ever wondered why there is so little money left in your bank and yet you do not feel that you spend excessively, so where did all your money go? Probably some are your personal expenditure but you do not keep track of your spending and overspent unknowingly, or maybe some money are owed by friends.

Whenever you’re out having a meal or having with your friends, someone in the group will offer to pay the bill first and collect money from everyone later on. Currently, there aren’t many popular apps to help the collection process.
Many have experienced that collecting money from their friends could be an arduous experience. Sometimes both the person collecting and the person who owes the money forget how much is being owed or even forget that money is being owed altogether! 

So, why isn’t there an app that could track personal spending and remind people how much money they owe or is owed to them? Moreover, it would also be easier for people to track their spending, debts all in the same place!

USER STORIES

As someone who wants to collect money from people, I want to be able to remind people to return the money that they owe and also for me to know how much money other people owe me.

As someone who owes people money, I want to be reminded to return the money and the amount I owe.

As someone who could be too busy at times and lose track of my own spending and then spent excessively, I want to be able to track my spending anytime, anywhere.

As a user, I want to make sure that I can confirm every step of the process to ensure that others do not randomly accuse me of owing them money.
